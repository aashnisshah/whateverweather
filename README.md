##Shout out to:
1. [Free GEO IP](http://freegeoip.net/json/)
2. [Forecast IO](https://api.forecast.io/forecast/)
3. [Icon Works @ Flat Icon](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/icon-works)

## How It Works
The extenion calls on freegeoip in order to obtain where you are. It then uses this information whilst calling the forecast api. The forecast api returns back the current weather, which is then diplayed on the extension page.
